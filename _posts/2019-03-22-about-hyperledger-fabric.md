# About HyperLedger Fabric

## What is HyperLedger Fabric?

Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation.

Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. it supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust module.

Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, gerneral-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency.

## Advantages of Hyperledger Fabric architecture 

- Chaincode trust flexibility
- Scalability
- Confidentiality
- Consensus modularity

## System architecture
